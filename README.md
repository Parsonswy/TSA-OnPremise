# TSA-OnPremise History
Legacy System - None of these iterations are used in production now, but serve as a portfolio and path of learning experiences.

# What
The "Team Savannah Auction Program," is an event management platform developed for the annual Team Savannah Arthritus Foundation Auction. Notable system features include individual patron credit accounts, storefronts for resale items, silent auction tracking, line-item transaction history, pin/photo-id security, PDF receipt generation, and instant financial statistics. None of these archived iterations atually interfaced with a payment processors, but they would track patron spending throuhgout an event night to depriciate tedious, manual labor and imrpoove efficiency. At the end of an event, a total for external billing with an itemized receipt were generated for cashout. We typically used PayPal with an exteranal card reader for the monitary processing.

# How 
Originally, "the auction program" was a LAMP app run off a RaspberryPI over a secure WLAN. Everything was accessed from internet-browser capable devices using QRCodes/scanners to identify accounts. 

# Before 2018
This is the programatic history of the TSA Auction program. Since the project was developed by teenage me and Google, and I didn't know of / bother with version control for the first few years, the major releases that were saved on the development server have been comitted here for record. The release notes have some details about significant milestones, both for the program and my personal development.

# After 2018
Support and exposure from Team Savannah led to outside interest of this application. I've handled multiple event requests since then and the auction program concept has begun to transition from a fun side project to a potential business venture. That shift has also brought about several changes to the archetecture of the application. Chief among these changes is the migration to cloud infrastructure. I've begun porting of this code, as well as system-changes needed to facilitate deployment on the open interent. Further feature expansion is also in the works, one of the first major items on the list being payment gateway integration. Beyond that there is a several year roadmap in place to expand TSA into a diverse event management platform that anyone can signup for and use.

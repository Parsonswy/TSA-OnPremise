# TSA-OnPremise History
Legacy System - None of these iterations are used in production now, but serve as a portfolio and path of learning experiences.

# How 
All the code here was run off a RaspberryPI on a WLAN router. Everything was accessed from smartphones using QRCodes/scanners to identify accounts - that's what all the qrGateway.php files handled.

# Then
This is the programatic history of the TSA Auction program. Since the project was developed by teenage me and Google, and I didn't know of / bother with version control for the first few years, the major releases that were saved on the development server have been comitted here for record. The release notes have some notes about the historical significants, both for the program and my personal development.
A recount of the project's inception can be found at https://tsauction.org/about-us

# After 2018
The development of a cloud-based webservice application has begun and is intended to replace the RaspberryPI which powered the code posted before you. Right now the platform is being ported to run on the Google App Engine, while enchancments to security and changes to the core system concepts are made to accomodate potentially running multiple simulatnious events over the internet.
